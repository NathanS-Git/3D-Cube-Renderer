# Hypercube renderer

This renders an n-dimensional [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube) and rotates it about all of its planes of rotations.

## Examples

A simple 3D cube perspective projected.

And last but not least, just for some fun, a rendering of a 10D Hypercube (in perspective projection).
